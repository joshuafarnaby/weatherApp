This is my version of Traversy Media's Weather App API Project. I decided not to follow along with the tutorial and instead simply took the idea and applied what I have learnt so far into getting it built. The project employed HTML, CSS and Javascript, with no frameworks or libraries, and brought together OOP and Asynchronous programming.

The API employed for that project is no longer free to use so I chose the OpenWeather API in its stead.

In broad strokes, this project involved making a GET request to the API, formatting the received data so it could be used by the app, and outputting to data to the UI. I made use of ES6 classes to effect OOP and ES6 promises to handle asychronous calls.
